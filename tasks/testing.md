### Testing and review

The entire team checks print, website, ebook and app editions, and submits any crucial adjustments online.

At this point, the team can produce editions of the book that look like the finished product: PDFs (e.g. for printing), a website, an ebook, and an app. They use thorough in-house checklists to test these, and provide copies to the director and their collaborators for review.

Ideally, the director and collaborators can continue to edit and preview the book using an online content-management system for book production. This lets non-technical users edit, preview, and contribute changes to their books from anywhere, at any time. This will be important for ongoing updates after publication.
