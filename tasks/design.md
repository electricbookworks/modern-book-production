### Design

A designer creates the visual look-and-feel for the project in mockups of covers and pages.
{:.summary}

When the manuscript is ready for production, a designer creates the look-and-feel for the project: landing pages, book covers, and page designs for web, mobile, ebook, and print editions. They work with a sample of the text to create mock-ups for the project team to review. Their designs include an example of every feature that the publication might include, such as headings, figures, quotations, question boxes, and so on.
